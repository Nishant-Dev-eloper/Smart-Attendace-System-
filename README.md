# Smart-Attendace-System-
An intelligent Attendance System using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm for facial recognition. Automatically detects and records student presence, ensures accuracy, and reduces manual effort. Combines computer vision with real-time tracking for efficient attendance management

Technologies Used:

.Python – Core programming language
.OpenCV – For image processing and face recognition
.NumPy – For numerical operations
.SQLite / CSV – For storing attendance records
.Tkinter – For GUI (optional)

Data--

.Dataset of student images for training the LBPH model
.Real-time webcam capture for recognition
.Attendance records stored in a structured format (CSV/DB)

Users--

.Teachers / Professors – For automated class attendance
.Institutions – To maintain accurate attendance logs
.Students – To verify recorded attendance

Algorithm--

.LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram):
.Detects facial features by analyzing local pixel patterns
.Converts image regions into histograms to encode texture
.Compares histograms to recognize faces
.Works efficiently even under varying lighting conditions

Features--

.Real-time face detection and recognition
.Automatic attendance marking
.Easy-to-use interface
.Efficient and accurate recognition even in small datasets
